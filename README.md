# kerr

Gamifying work performance according to "How to be great at your job" by Justin Kerr.

I init in a project, and provide updates, with which I score points. When I end each day I want a report of how well I did and areas I need to improve in. At the end of the week, I get goals to improve in areas.

## Commands

kerr [command]

`init` set up current project
`task` list tasks in this project
`task [task detals]` create a new task
